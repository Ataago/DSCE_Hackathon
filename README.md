The DSCE Hackathon project - DO SOMETHING

# Do Something
### A Platform to get Help and Give Help.

# IDEA

- A platform where users can post “tasks” with their mobile phones in order to get help with the things they want to improve in the society.
- These things can be anything from household help to, clean up neighbourhoods.
- Other users can Upvote these tasks that they too want to see happening.
- NGO’s and other users can then provide their help  with these tasks.


# Features

- A feature to let users post on a task that they are "doing something", or add to the problems of the task in hand.
- Ability to Upvote/Downvote "tasks" that users want to happen more/less.
- The app developed sorts the tasks based on "fresh", "trending", and "most help wanted".
- User login system (Using a Node.js based server and a MongoDB database).
- Initial front-end systems built on android and possible web based in the future.
- A vision and possibility that NGO's can use the app to help people using the app.
